    "text": "My name is Bryana and I am in my last semester as an undergraduate majoring in Psychology and Statistics at St. Lawrence University. I will be going into a PhD program for Behavior Analysis after I graduate investigating addiction and addiction-like behavior particularly in vulnerable and sensitive populations. The past 3 years I have been fortunate to do animal model research evaluating the long-term effects of chronic early-life stress on impulsive-like behavior. This blog will revolve around these topic in order to increase awareness through beautiful and easily digestible data visualizations.\n———————————————————————————————————————–"

    "section": "Dataset",
    "text": "Dataset\nThe first data set we will be exploring is data scrapped from a CDC website article named, “Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences Among U.S. Adults — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2011–2020” and can be found here in Table 1. This data was collected from 2011 to 2020 and is one of the most complete surveys that has currently been done in the United States on adverse childhood event prevalence.\nThe information scraped from the website is the summary statistics by state and categorized by adverse childhood type. More specifically, the adverse childhood events were categorized by emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member. Generally speaking, these are the 8 most commonly collected adverse childhood events. In addition, we also have the response rate by state and year which is an important measure to keep in mind when evaluating the data due to response bias.\nIMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Adverse childhood experiences that are emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse are events that happen directly to the child. In comparison, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member are adverse childhood experiences where the child is present (i.e., a bystander). These events create instability and uncertainty for a child resulting in a chronic stress environment and have been shown repeatedly to increase risk for a multitude of illnesses and risky/maladaptive behaviors.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThis dataset has many abbreviations and could be interpreted wrong without the following operational definitions from the study expressed in questions asked (These were not the only questions asked to determine if the person experienced a specific adverse childhood event, but I hope this gives a better idea on how this was defined).\n\nEmotional abuse (Emotional):\n\n“How often did a parent or adult in your home ever swear at you, insult you, or put you down?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nPhysical abuse (Physical):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever hit, beat, kick, or physically hurt you in any way? Do not include spanking” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSexual abuse (Sexual):\n\n“How often did anyone at least 5 years older than you or an adult, ever try to make you touch them sexually?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSeparated/Divorced (SeparatedDivorced):\n\n“Were your parents separated or divorced?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nMental illness in the household (Mental_Illness_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill or suicidal?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nSubstance Use in household (Substance_Use_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who used illegal street drugs or who abused prescription medications?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nDomestic violence in household (DV):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever slap, hit, kick, punch or beat each other up?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nIncarcerated household member (Incarcerated_HM):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who served time or was sentenced to serve time in prison, jail, or other correctional facility?” (answers: no vs. yes)"

    "text": "Response Rate\n\nA “good” response rate is about 95%, but because this is a very sensitive topic we see a much lower response rate. The reason why response rate is important to keep in mind is because you are more likely to have response bias in your data (i.e., those who are passionate or care about responding do respond and those who don’t care do not leaving the data biased). This is just something we should keep in mind as we look at the data because states with a response rate of 40% are going to have a different bias level compared to states with a response rate of 60%.\n\nThis map shows that there was higher response rates from states in the middle of the country compared to the states on the west or east coast. Mississippi had by far the highest response rate compared to all other states."

    "section": "Substance Use in the Household",
    "text": "Substance Use in the Household\n\nOn prevalence of substance use in the household, there looks to be a general prevalence overall of 25%, but greater prevalence in the northwest (not exclusively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nPrevalence of physical abuse shown through the map appears to be greater in the southwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Illness in Household\n\nThis map graph is interesting because it appears mental illness in the household is most prevalent in a much greater way in Utah compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic Violence in Household\n\nInterestingly, in this map we see Nevada stand out as having a much greater percentage of domestic violence compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual Abuse\n\nOregon stands out as having a larger percentage of sexual abuse occur compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncarcerated Household Member\n\nIn the map, we see a trend of higher percentages of a household member being incarcerated in the southeast region. This generally makes sense because those states have a tendency to have a higher percentage of residences that are people of color, and due to systemic racism, those with a darker complexion are more likely to be incarcerated wrongfully or for petty crimes compared to white people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates Above 75th Percentile\nSomething I noticed when doing this is that many of the states above the 75th percentile for a specific adverse childhood event prevalence showed up multiple times. To evaluate this further I decided to do the graph below which shows all the states that were included in at least one 75th percentile dataset to evaluate exactly how many times specific states showed up in the 75th percentile across different adverse childhood events.\nIn a sense, it does make sense that if a state had shown up once in a 75th percentile datasets that they would most likely show up again because instability leads to more instability. This visual, in my opinion, shows a real problem occurring within certain states."

On the emotional abuse prevalence map by state, we see a general pattern that emotional abuse is reported more on the west coast compared to the east coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation/Divorce\n\nOn the separation or divorce prevalence map by state, we see a general trend of a higher concentration of separations and divorces in the southeast."
