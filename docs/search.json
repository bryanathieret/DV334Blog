    "section": "Dataset",
    "text": "Dataset\nThe first data set we will be exploring is data scrapped from a CDC website article named, “Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences Among U.S. Adults — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2011–2020” and can be found here in Table 1. This data was collected from 2011 to 2020 and is one of the most complete surveys that has currently been done in the United States on adverse childhood event prevalence.\nThe information scraped from the website is the summary statistics by state and categorized by adverse childhood type. More specifically, the adverse childhood events were categorized by emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member. Generally speaking, these are the 8 most commonly collected adverse childhood events. In addition, we also have the response rate by state and year which is an important measure to keep in mind when evaluating the data due to response bias.\nIMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Adverse childhood experiences that are emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse are events that happen directly to the child. In comparison, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member are adverse childhood experiences where the child is present (i.e., a bystander). These events create instability and uncertainty for a child resulting in a chronic stress environment and have been shown repeatedly to increase risk for a multitude of illnesses and risky/maladaptive behaviors.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThis dataset has many abbreviations and could be interpreted wrong without the following operational definitions from the study expressed in questions asked (These were not the only questions asked to determine if the person experienced a specific adverse childhood event, but I hope this gives a better idea on how this was defined).\n\nEmotional abuse (Emotional):\n\n“How often did a parent or adult in your home ever swear at you, insult you, or put you down?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nPhysical abuse (Physical):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever hit, beat, kick, or physically hurt you in any way? Do not include spanking” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSexual abuse (Sexual):\n\n“How often did anyone at least 5 years older than you or an adult, ever try to make you touch them sexually?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSeparated/Divorced (SeparatedDivorced):\n\n“Were your parents separated or divorced?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nMental illness in the household (Mental_Illness_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill or suicidal?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nSubstance Use in household (Substance_Use_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who used illegal street drugs or who abused prescription medications?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nDomestic violence in household (DV):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever slap, hit, kick, punch or beat each other up?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nIncarcerated household member (Incarcerated_HM):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who served time or was sentenced to serve time in prison, jail, or other correctional facility?” (answers: no vs. yes)"

    "text": "Response Rate\n\nA “good” response rate is about 95%, but because this is a very sensitive topic we see a much lower response rate. The reason why response rate is important to keep in mind is because you are more likely to have response bias in your data (i.e., those who are passionate or care about responding do respond and those who don’t care do not leaving the data biased). This is just something we should keep in mind as we look at the data because states with a response rate of 40% are going to have a different bias level compared to states with a response rate of 60%.\n\nThis map shows that there was higher response rates from states in the middle of the country compared to the states on the west or east coast. Mississippi had by far the highest response rate compared to all other states."

    "text": "Substance Use in the Household\n\nOn prevalence of substance use in the household, there looks to be a general prevalence overall of 25%, but greater prevalence in the northwest (not exclusively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nPrevalence of physical abuse shown through the map appears to be greater in the southwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Illness in Household\n\nThis map graph is interesting because it appears mental illness in the household is most prevalent in a much greater way in Utah compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic Violence in Household\n\nInterestingly, in this map we see Nevada stand out as having a much greater percentage of domestic violence compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual Abuse\n\nOregon stands out as having a larger percentage of sexual abuse occur compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncarcerated Household Member\n\nIn the map, we see a trend of higher percentages of a household member being incarcerated in the southeast region. This generally makes sense because those states have a tendency to have a higher percentage of residences that are people of color, and due to systemic racism, those with a darker complexion are more likely to be incarcerated wrongfully or for petty crimes compared to white people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates Above 75th Percentile\nSomething I noticed when doing this is that many of the states above the 75th percentile for a specific adverse childhood event prevalence showed up multiple times. To evaluate this further I decided to do the graph below which shows all the states that were included in at least one 75th percentile dataset to evaluate exactly how many times specific states showed up in the 75th percentile across different adverse childhood events.\nIn a sense, it does make sense that if a state had shown up once in a 75th percentile datasets that they would most likely show up again because instability leads to more instability. This visual, in my opinion, shows a real problem occurring within certain states."

    "text": "Demographics of Those Experiencing ACEs\n\nGender\nThe gender category consisted of males or females. We know gender is a spectrum and I would like to acknowledge that these two categories do not represent everyone especially as a general population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments:\n\nOverall, a greater percentage of females report experiencing ACEs compared to males.\n\nSimilarities between genders for ACE reporting is shown for categories of emotional abuse and parental separation or divorce, but females report a greater prevalence of substance use in the household, sexual abuse (this large difference could also be due to under reporting for males because it is very stigmatized), mental illness in the household, and domestic violence in the household compared to males who report a greater prevalence of physical abuse and having an incarcerated household member.\n\n\n\nAge\nThe age category consisted of 6 groupings: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and \\(\\geq\\) 65. Understanding prevalence of ACEs at different ages can provide vital information as to trends through different generations of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Age Group:\n\nThe figure above shows the prevalence of ACEs decreasing over generations which is a positive finding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories for domestic violence in the household, physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental separation or divorce, and substance use in the household show a general increase between age categories 55-64 through 25-34 but show a decrease in age grouping 18-24. This could be indicative of positive change occurring.\n\nACE categories for emotional abuse, mental illness in the household, and having an incarcerated household member show little to no change from age groups 18-24 to 25-34 which demonstrates a continued problem observable over generations.\n\n\n\nRace and Ethnicity\nThe race and ethnicity category consisted of 8 groupings:\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic,\n\nHispanic or Latino,\n\nBlack or African American, non-Hispanic,\n\nAsian, non-Hispanic,\n\nMultiracial, non-Hispanic,\n\nAI/AN, non-Hispanic (American Indian/Alaska Native),\n\nOther race, non-Hispanic,\n\nNH/OPI, non-Hispanic (Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Race/Ethnicity Group:\n\nWhite is a bit over represented here for the population of the United States and more marginalized categories are slightly under represented in this sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nIn particular, for ACE categories of emotional abuse, incarcerated household member, mental illness in the household, and substance abuse in the household, both Multiracial and American Indian’s and/or Alaska Native’s report to have a much higher prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\nFor ACE categories of having an incarcerated household member and parental separation or divorce, people with race/ethnicity of Multiracial, American Indian and/or Alaska Native, or Black/African American report a much higher prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\nFor ACE categories of domestic violence in the household and sexual abuse, people with race/ethnicity of Multiracial, American Indian and/or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander report to have the greatest prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\n\n\nIncome\nThe income category consisted of 5 groupings:\n\n&lt;$15,000,\n\n$15,000-$24,999,\n\n$25,000-$34,999,\n\n$35,000-$49,999,\n\n&gt;$50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Income Group:\n\nA large percentage of those participating in this survey are making greater than $50,000 per year, but not as large as one might expect considering the average income in the US (in 2023) is just below 60,000 according to the census.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories of domestic violence in the household, parental separation or divorce, physical abuse, and sexual abuse have distinct trends where higher prevalence results in increased impairments in yearly income. These ACE categories compared to the others all stem from an unstable household where safety may not, and in many cases is not, present which has been shown to lead to profound long-term effects that this visual also illustrates clearly.\n\nACE categories where an increase in prevalence is more subtle to changes in income per year are substance use in the household and having an incarcerated household member.\n\nACE categories where prevalence does not appear to have a severe impact on later income per year are mental illness in the household and emotional abuse.\n\n\n\nEducation\nThe education category consisted of 4 groupings:\n\nLess than high school,\n\nHigh school diploma or GED,\nSome college,\nCollege degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Education Group:\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics the dropout rate from high school was 8.3% in 2010 and 5.2% in 2021, so the survey’s population generally have higher prevalence of not finishing high school compared to the national average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories for domestic violence in the household, physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental separation or divorce, substance abuse in the household, and having an incarcerated household member show a clear trend that greater prevalence results in much higher rates of dropping out of high school.\n\nBoth emotional abuse and mental illness in the household show a greater prevalence of dropping out of college, but interestingly, those with higher prevalence report also having a college degree compared to it being less prevalent to report dropping out of high school.\n\nOverall, it should be noted that those reporting ACEs of physical abuse, substance abuse in the household, parental separation or divorce, and emotional abuse appear to have a significant impact on dropping out of high school because around 30% of people reporting not completing high school also report one of these ACEs which is a huge problem.\n\n\n\nEmployment\nEmployment consists of 4 groupings:\n\nOther,\n\nUnemployed,\n\nUnable to work,\n\nEmployed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Employment Group:\n\nThe figure above shows that the majority of those in the survey are employed or other. I was unable to find anything conclusive on what the category other meant in this survey, but based on some searching the “other” category used when asked about employment often refers to self-employment or being an independent contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nMost categories of ACEs have those reporting unemployment or unable to work as relatively the same prevalence (i.e., domestic violence, physical abuse, and mental illness in the household), but those who have experienced adversity of emotional abuse, parental separation or divorce, or having an incarcerated household member are shown to report more unemployment compared to unable to work.\n\nBoth sexual abuse and substance use in the household report higher prevalence of unable to work compared to unemployed.\n\nAll ACE categories besides sexual abuse report higher prevalence of employed compared to “other” whereas those who report sexual abuse have the same prevalence for being employed compared to “other”."

I do not have the original data from this study which is limiting. Another factor that should be mentioned is that this data was collected through surveys and was likely to have a response bias from the low response rate.\nI have yet to see anyone do this or explore this avenue of how the type of ACE effects a person, and based on the findings, it should be further looked into how or if differing types of ACEs have different risk factors along with result in different long-term effects for the person. If we know certain populations are more at risk for certain ACEs, our goal should be targeting those populations to prevent, or limit, the ACE before it occurs."

Substance use when started, is extremely hard to extinguish because it is chemically/behaviorally addictive and relapse/resurgence is very common due to the established history of reinforcement with the substance (e.g., place can be a trigger for relapse, people can be a trigger for relapse, trauma can be a trigger for relapse, etc.,). This makes it especially difficult to treat and establish maintenance behavior for substance use.\nI am particularly interested in this data because we know those who have a history of adversity or adverse childhood events have an increased risk for early and life time substance use dependence compared to the general population (Kim et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2018; Strine et al., 2012; Pilowsky et al., 2009; Loudermilk et al., 2018; Dube et al., 2003; Gomez et al., 2018; Stein et al., 2017; Guarino et al., 2021; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2016; Dube et al., 2001).

The data set includes the number of deaths per year between 1999 through 2021 categorized by the type of substance(s) that caused the death. There were many categories but I ultimately decided to group these categories further by the substance medication class (i.e., opioids, opiates, narcotics, stimulants, etc.,). The exact grouping were as follows,\n\nOpioids: synthetically derived opiates.\n\nPrescription opioids (Prescription Opioids2)\n\nPrescription opioids other than methadone (Prescription Opioids WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nSynthetic opioids (Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone (primarily fentanyl)3)\n\nOpiates: compounds that are extracted or refined from natural plant matter (poppy sap and fibers).\n\nHeroin (Heroin4)\n\nNarcotics: this includes both opiates and opioids.\n\nBoth opiates and opioids (Any Opioid1)\n\nPrescription and synthetic opioids other than methadone (Prescription Opioids AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nHeroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone (Heroin AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nHeroin and methadone (Heroin WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nStimulants: this includes cocaine, psychostimulants, and psychostimulants with abuse potential.\n\nStimulants without any opioids present (Stimulants WITHOUT Any Opioid)\n\nStimulants without any synthetic opioids present (Stimulants WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nCocaine without any opioid present (Cocaine WITHOUT Any Opioid)\n\nCocaine without any synthetic opioids present (Cocaine WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential (Psychostimulants With Abuse Potential (primarily methamphetamine)6)\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential without any opioid present (Psychostimulants With Abuse Potential WITHOUT Any Opioid)\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential without any synthetic opioids present (Psychostimulants With Abuse Potential WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nBenzodiazepine: depressants that produce sedation, relieve anxiety, reduces seizures, and are controlled substances because they are prone to misuse.\n\nBenzodiazepine without any opioid present (Benzodiazepines WITHOUT Any Opioid)\n\nBenzodiazepine without any synthetic opioid present other than methadone (Benzodiazepines WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nAntidepressant: there are many types of antidepressants which include SSRIs, SNRIs, NASSAs, TCAs, SARIs, and MAOIs.\n\nAntidepressants without any opioid present (Antidepressants WITHOUT Any Opioid)\n\nAntidepressants without synthetic opioids present (Antidepressants WITHOUT Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nStimulants and Opioids:\n\nStimulants and any opioid present (Stimulants AND Any Opioid)\n\nCocaine and any opioid present (Cocaine AND Any Opioid)\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential and any opioid present (Psychostimulants With Abuse Potential AND Any Opioid)\n\nStimulants and Narcotics:\n\nStimulants and narcotics (Stimulants AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nCocaine and narcotics (Cocaine AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nPsychostimulants with abuse potential and narcotics (Psychostimulants With Abuse Potential AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nBenzodiazepine and Opioids:\n\nBenzodiazepine and any opioid present (Benzodiazepines AND Any Opioid)\n\nBenzodiazepine and Narcotics:\n\nBenzodiazepine and narcotics present (Benzodiazepines AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\nAntidepressant and Opioids:\n\nAntidepressant and any opioid present (Antidepressants AND Any Opioid)\n\nAntidepressant and Narcotics:\n\nAntidepressant and narcotics present (Antidepressants AND Synthetic Opioids other than Methadone)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go to the article where this data came from there is a relatively good write up with both tables, graphs, and interpretations but the way the author categorized the drugs did not, in my opinion, differentiate between opiates and opioids. Both opiates and opioids are highly addictive substances (primary reinforcers), but they neurochemically work differently within our nervous systems which is why it is important to not categorize the substances together as the same because they are indeed not the same. This exploration will dive into understanding if there are different trends over time for opiate vs opioid overdoses in addition to polysubstance use involving opioids and opiates. In addition, there is relatively building evidence of biological sex differences for substance addiction so in order to control for those potential differences we will be differentiating between the number of overdoses by sex for all categorizations."

On the other hand, prescription opiates look unstable in terms of the number of overdoses from 2020 to 2021 where males overdoses increased sharply and females overdosed on the substance significantly less. We know that supply and ultimately cost of a substance is going to effect whether a person takes a particular substance. This sudden decrease for overdoses for prescription opiates for females is most likely due to switching to another substance that has similar reinforcing value (i.e., the way it makes the person feel) but is more available/cheaper.\n\n\n\nOpioids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescription opioids appear to have been climbing in the number of overdoses since 1999 which is extremely concerning as a society. Fentanyl has become a more popular substance lately especially for overdoses because the concentration of the substance is much higher than any other opioid or opiate. Even though fentanyl has recently been causing the majority of overdoese in the recent years, it is not a new drug and has been around for decades as a pain medication often given as a shot or through IV.\n\n\n\nOpiates vs. Opioids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows that overdoses from opiates has been decreasing as a rate, second derivative negative, since 2015 for both males and females. On the other hand there appears to be a shift to increased overdoses as a rate over years, second derivative positive, for both males and females which is concerning because the trend only appears to be continuing to increase, and predicatively, will continue to increase."

    "section": "Polysubstance Use",
    "text": "Polysubstance Use\nIt is relatively common for multiple substances to be taken together which can be harder for a persons body to process leading to health complications (e.g., heart attack) but also can increase the risk of overdosing because substances can be laced with other substances that might create a biologically problematic interaction or too much of a particular substance. Since opiates and opioids have been lumped together in regards to polysubstance overdoses, I will show the number of overdoses for a substance without the presence of a narcotic and the same substance with the presence of a narcotic.\n\nStimulants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, stimulants were not previously taken with narcotics between 1999 to 2012, but around 2013 for males and 2015 for females, stimulants and narcotics began to be mixed together causing overdoses. In a similar trend, both males and females in the past 4 years have been overdosing at higher rates when stimulants are mixed with narcotics compared to stimulants being taken alone.\n\n\n\nBenzodiazepine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows very obviously that those using both narcotics and benzodiazepine often results in some type of overdose death. Benzodiazepine can cause hallucinations which could impair a persons ability to make rational decisions, but also judgement of their perceived “highness” causing them to take too much of a narcotic leading to overdose.\n\n\n\nAntidepressants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2006 through 2021, there is a clear trend of females overdosing overall at a much higher rate compared to males generally speaking for both antidepressants alone and when antidepressants and narcotics are present. We can reasonably say those overdosing on antidepressants is a type of suicide, but it is hard to say if the antidepressant found in a toxicology report was their daily medication or if it was at a much higher dose along with either a opiate or opioid which would mean different things."

Outpatient centers are essential to help those with addictions pick up their life, but what is not often acknowledged is that those who have a history of substance addiction are prone to relapse, not because of their lack of self control, but because they have a history of reinforcement with the substance that will never go away. The way to treat substance addiction is to prevent it from occurring all together rather than as a society caring once it is way too late."

Do not include spanking” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSexual abuse (Sexual):\n\n“How often did anyone at least 5 years older than you or an adult, ever try to make you touch them sexually?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSeparated/Divorced (SeparatedDivorced):\n\n“Were your parents separated or divorced?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nMental illness in the household (Mental_Illness_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill or suicidal?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nSubstance Use in household (Substance_Use_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who used illegal street drugs or who abused prescription medications?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nDomestic violence in household (DV):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever slap, hit, kick, punch or beat each other up?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nIncarcerated household member (Incarcerated_HM):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who served time or was sentenced to serve time in prison, jail, or other correctional facility?” (answers: no vs. yes)"

    "text": "Response Rate\n\nA “good” response rate is about 95%, but because this is a very sensitive topic we see a much lower response rate. The reason why response rate is important to keep in mind is because you are more likely to have response bias in your data (i.e., those who are passionate or care about responding do respond and those who don’t care do not leaving the data biased). This is just something we should keep in mind as we look at the data because states with a response rate of 40% are going to have a different bias level compared to states with a response rate of 60%.\n\nThis map shows that there was higher response rates from states in the middle of the country compared to the states on the west or east coast. Mississippi had by far the highest response rate compared to all other states."

This generally makes sense because those states have a tendency to have a higher percentage of residences that are people of color, and due to systemic racism, those with a darker complexion are more likely to be incarcerated wrongfully or for petty crimes compared to white people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates Above 75th Percentile\nSomething I noticed when doing this is that many of the states above the 75th percentile for a specific adverse childhood event prevalence showed up multiple times. To evaluate this further I decided to do the graph below which shows all the states that were included in at least one 75th percentile dataset to evaluate exactly how many times specific states showed up in the 75th percentile across different adverse childhood events.\nIn a sense, it does make sense that if a state had shown up once in a 75th percentile datasets that they would most likely show up again because instability leads to more instability. This visual, in my opinion, shows a real problem occurring within certain states."

    "text": "Adverse childhood events (ACE) are adversities that occur from birth to 18 years old and are often categorized into 8 major categories consisting of emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, incarcerated household member, parental separation or divorce (Merrick et al., 2018). They are categorized/standardized in this way to be able to collect data on prevalence of ACEs in a population. There is a plethora of evidence that shows ACEs and early-life adversity (ELA) increases risk for addiction and addiction-like behavior (Felitti et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2018; Strine et al., 2012; Loudermilk et al., 2018; Pilowsky et al., 2009; Dube et al., 2003; Sharma & Sacco, 2015; Kim et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2018; Guarino et al., 2021; Stein et al., 2017).\nPrevious research shows that the greater the number of ACEs a person a person experiences, the greater the risk becomes for maladaptive and impulsive long-term behavior. The problem with categorizing by number is it ignores the potential for different types of adversity to have different long-term risks. The present research explores the impact of the type of adversity and alcohol consumption through 4 questions asked in The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey."

In order to avoid this we will be modeling through quasipoisson regressions which will adjust the standard errors if there is overdispersion present.

    "text": "Alcohol consumption in days per week\nThe first question refers to the number of days per week the respondent reports drinking an alcoholic beverage. This question has been coded in a way that allows the respondent to report if they do not drink alcohol generally speaking which was excluded in this analysis to evaluate if the consumption of alcohol per week differs between those who report a history of early-life adversity compared to those who have not.\n\nInterpretation\nThose who are female, between the ages of 18-24, and report no history of an ACE drink on average 2.84 days out of the 7 days a week (\\(\\beta_0 = 2.84\\), \\(SE = 0.26\\), \\(t = 4.03\\), \\(p &lt; .0001\\)). Those who are males do not on average report any different from the average number of days where alcohol is consumed compared to females, between the ages of 18-24, that report no history of an ACE (\\(\\beta_1 = 1.00\\), \\(SE = 0.13\\), \\(t = -0.01\\), \\(p = 0.989\\)).

Interactions between ACEs that also report being a male do not show any differences in relative risk for average days to consume alcohol per week compared to females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE (see Table 3).\nThose that report a history of mental illness in the household that are also between the ages of 25 to 34 show on average a 1.27 times greater number of days per week compared to females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE (\\(\\beta_8 = 1.27\\), \\(SE = 0.09\\), \\(t = 2.63\\), \\(p = .0084\\)). In addition, those who generally report a history of mental illness in the household and/or are a part of any other age category do not report any differently from the average number of days that those that are females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE consume alcohol per week (see Table 3 for further information).\nAll other interactions between ACEs and age category show no difference in relative risk for average days to consume alcohol per week compared to females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE (see Table 3 for further information).\nTable 3\nEstimates for ACE Terms and Interactions\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nMentalIllness1\n0.90\n0.08\n-1.29\n0.1979417\n\n\nMentalIllness1:sexMale\n1.00\n0.03\n0.03\n0.9748654\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age25 to 34\n1.27\n0.09\n2.63\n0.0084309\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age35 to 44\n1.11\n0.09\n1.15\n0.2517294\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age45 to 54\n1.17\n0.09\n1.80\n0.0716143\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age55 to 64\n1.17\n0.09\n1.77\n0.0768719\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age65 or &gt;

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe research presented demonstrates that the type of adversity matters when discussing risk for excessive alcohol consumption. In addition, when grouping adversities by the number reported, there is a clear distinction between ACE groupings indicating that grouping by number experienced is not an accurate way to determine those most at risk for excessive alcohol consumption. There was also some evidence that those with a history of specific ACEs are shown to engage in less overall alcohol consumption which has not previously been reported in the literature.\nFuture research investigating ACEs should focus on the type of adversities and interaction between adversities rather than adding the number of ACEs experienced together and using that as the dependent variable of interest. As shown, a lot of information is lost when this is done because long-term effects from parental separation or divorce are not comparable to those who had a household member with a substance addiction.\nThe data used and conclusions made here are based on self-reported data with a large potential to be skewed because ACEs is a sensitive topic, especially to those who have a history of adversity, where individuals are less likely to report them with a stranger. This is the only survey in the United States that collects information on ACEs yearly which is why it was used in this analysis. The resulted presented here are indicated as increased, decreased, or no difference in risk from the intercept group, but there is a potential that there are confounding variables because we are only accounting for this aspect of the respondents life history which is not the only variable that could effect long-term risk for excessive alcohol consumption. Visualizations try to evaluate a plethora of variables at one time which has the potential to be confusing/difficult for people to grasp what is being shown. It is also impossible with the current data to determine if age is impacting alcohol consumption as a measure of time passing or if generations are experiencing different effects."

    "text": "Alcohol consumption in days per month\nThe second question refers to the number of days per month the respondent consumes at least one alcoholic drink. This question has been coded in a way that allows the respondent to report if they do not drink alcohol at all which was excluded in this analysis to evaluate if the consumption of alcohol per week differs between those who report a history of early-life stress compared to those who have not.\n\nInterpretation\nThose who are female, between the ages of 18-24, and report no history of an ACE report on average drink an alcoholic beverage 5.74 days out of a month (\\(\\beta_0 = 5.74\\), \\(SE = 0.35\\), \\(t = 5.06\\), \\(p &lt; .00001\\)). Those who are male on average do not report any increased or decreased risk for the number of days to consume an alcoholic beverage out of a month compared to females between the ages of 18-24 and report no history of an ACE (\\(\\beta_1 = 1.25\\), \\(SE = 0.16\\), \\(t = 1.42\\), \\(p = .155\\)). Those who are between the ages of 25 to 34 (\\(\\beta_2 = 0.98\\), \\(SE = 0.37\\), \\(t = -0.05\\), \\(p = .957\\)), 35 to 44 (\\(\\beta_3 = 0.66\\), \\(SE = 0.40\\), \\(t = -1.05\\), \\(p = 0.292\\)), 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_4 = 1.11\\), \\(SE = 0.37\\), \\(t = 0.29\\), \\(p = .769\\)), 55 to 64 (\\(\\beta_5 = 1.43\\), \\(SE = 0.35\\), \\(t = 1.01\\), \\(p = 0.315\\)), or 65 and older (\\(\\beta_6 = 1.52\\), \\(SE = 0.34\\), \\(t = 1.24\\), \\(p = 0.215\\)) do not show any increased risk for the number of days on average to consume alcohol out of the month compared to females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE.\nThose that reported a history of rape that were also between the ages of 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_{78} = 0.60\\), \\(SE = 0.17\\), \\(t = -2.95\\), \\(p = .003\\)), or 65 and older (\\(\\beta_{80} = 0.65\\), \\(SE = 0.16\\), \\(t = -2.66\\), \\(p = .008\\)), respectively, were shown to have an on average 0.60 or 0.65 times lower risk for the number of days per month alcohol was consumed per month compared to females between the ages of 18-24 and not history of any ACE. Those that also report the same history of adversity but are between the ages of 25 to 34 or 55 to 64 were not shown to report on average a different number of days per month alcohol is consumed compared to females between the ages of 18-24 and no history of any ACE (see Table 4 for further information).\nThere were no two-way interactions between males and any of the 13 ACEs that indicated increased or decreased risk for the average number of days per month alcohol was consumed compared to females between the ages of 18-24 and no history of any ACE (see Table 4 for further information). In addition, all other interactions between ACEs and age category were shown not to differ in relative risk for average days to consume alcohol per month compared to females between the ages of 18-24 that report no history of an ACE (see Table 2).\nTable 4\nEstimates for ACE Terms and Interactions\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nMentalIllness1\n1.02\n0.07\n0.25\n0.7997453\n\n\nMentalIllness1:sexMale\n0.95\n0.03\n-1.52\n0.1279668\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age25 to 34\n1.06\n0.08\n0.76\n0.4443003\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age35 to 44\n1.08\n0.08\n1.05\n0.2936810\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age45 to 54\n1.07\n0.08\n0.83\n0.4052683\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age55 to 64\n1.03\n0.08\n0.39\n0.6934069\n\n\nMentalIllness1:age65 or &gt;

    "text": "Occasions of binge drinking in the past month\nThe third question refers to the number of occasions in the past month where 5 or more alcoholic drinks are consumed if male or 4 or more alcoholic drinks are consumed if female. The CDC classifies 4 or more for females and 5 or more for males as excessive alcohol use or binge drinking. This question was only asked if the respondent indicated they consumed alcohol.\n\nInterpretation\nIn a month females 65 and older with no history of any ACE on average are shown to drink 4 or more alcoholic drinks on 6.85 occasions (\\(\\beta_0 = 6.85\\), \\(SE = 0.28\\), \\(t = 6.83\\), \\(p &lt; .000001\\)). Those who report being a male are not shown to have any increased or decreased risk for the number of occasions where 5 or more drinks are consumed compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_1 = 1.06\\), \\(SE = 0.23\\), \\(t = 0.23\\), \\(p = .605\\)).\nThose that report being between the ages of 18 to 24 (\\(\\beta_6 = 1.80\\), \\(SE = 0.34\\), \\(t = 1.70\\), \\(p = .089\\)), 25 to 34 (\\(\\beta_2 = 0.59\\), \\(SE = 0.31\\), \\(t = -1.69\\), \\(p = .092\\)), 35 to 44 (\\(\\beta_3 = 0.48\\), \\(SE = 0.36\\), \\(t = -2.02\\), \\(p = .043\\)), 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_4 = 0.59\\), \\(SE = 0.34\\), \\(t = -1.56\\), \\(p = 0.118\\)), or 55 to 64 (\\(\\beta_5 = 1.03\\), \\(SE = 0.32\\), \\(t = 0.10\\), \\(p = .922\\)) are not shown to differ in occasions per month where binge drinking is observed compared to those that are females 65 and older with no history of any ACE.\nThose that are male and report a history of sexual assault (someone sexually touching the respondent) are shown to have 1.36 times more occasions per month where the person is binge drinking compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{68} = 1.36\\), \\(SE = 0.11\\), \\(t = 2.81\\), \\(p = .005\\)). Those who report being male along with a history of either mental illness in the household, or alcohol misuse in the household, or substance addiction in the household, or a history of someone forcing the respondent to touch someone else sexually, or having a household member incarcerated, or parental separation or divorce, or domestic violence in the household, or physical abuse, or emotional abuse, or rape, or neglect of any kind, were not seen to increase or decrease occasions per month where the person is binge drinking compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (see Table 5 for further information).\nThose that report a history of emotional abuse and that are also between the ages of 55 to 64 (\\(\\beta_{59} = 1.28\\), \\(SE = 0.09\\), \\(t = 2.69\\), \\(p = .007\\)) are shown to have 1.28 times more occasions per month where the person is binge drinking compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE, but those between the ages of 18 to 24, or 25 to 34, or 35 to 44, or 45 to 54 are not shown to effect the number of occasions per month where binge drinking occurs compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (see Table 5 for further information).\nThose that report no adult in your household who tried hard to make sure their basic needs were met (i.e., Neglect2) that were also between the ages of 18 to 24 were shown to have 0.37 times lower number of occasions per month where the person was binge drinking compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{95} = 0.37\\), \\(SE = 0.35\\), \\(t = -2.82\\), \\(p = .005\\)). The interaction between this ACE and other age category were not shown to effect the number of occasions per month where binge drinking occurs compared to females 65 and older with no history of any ACE (see Table 5 for further information).\nAll other interactions between the other 10 ACEs and age categories were shown not to differ in relative risk for average occasions to binge drink in the past month compared to females 65 and older that report no history of an ACE (see Table 5 for further information).\nTable 5\nEstimates for ACE Terms and

    "text": "Maximum number of drinks on any occasion in the past month\nThe fourth question refers to the largest number of drinks consumed in one occasion in the past month. This question, like the previous, is only asked to respondents that indicate they consume alcohol.\n\nInterpretation\nThose that were males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE in the past month that the largest average number of alcoholic drinks consumed on an occasion in the past month was 3.36 (\\(\\beta_{0} = 3.36\\), \\(SE = 0.09\\), \\(t = 13.52\\), \\(p &lt; .000001\\)). Females overall did not report on average any different maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_1 = 0.57\\), \\(SE = 0.22\\), \\(t = -2.50\\), \\(p = .012\\)). Those that were female and were also between the ages of 18 to 24, or 25 to 34, or 45 to 54, or 55 to 64, were not shown to report on average any differently compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE for the maximum number of drinks consumed on an occasion in the past month (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that were between the ages of 18 to 24 were shown to report on average 3.21 times more maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_2 = 3.21\\), \\(SE = 0.16\\), \\(t = 7.18\\), \\(p &lt; .000001\\)). Those that were between the ages of 25 to 34 were shown to report on average 1.89 times more maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_3 = 1.89\\), \\(SE = 0.13\\), \\(t = 4.78\\), \\(p &lt; .00001\\)). In addition, those that were either between the ages of 35 to 44 (\\(\\beta_4 = 1.15\\), \\(SE = 0.17\\), \\(t = 0.82\\), \\(p = .409\\)), or 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_5 = 0.97\\), \\(SE = 0.17\\), \\(t = -0.18\\), \\(p = .854\\)), or 55 to 64 (\\(\\beta_6 = 1.30\\), \\(SE = 0.16\\), \\(t = 1.66\\), \\(p = .097\\)) were not shown to differ in the average maximum number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE.\nThose that report a history of parental separation or divorce were shown to have 1.11 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{55} = 1.11\\), \\(SE = 0.03\\), \\(t = 3.25\\), \\(p = .001\\)). Those that reported a history of parental separation or divorce and that were also between the ages of 35 to 44 (\\(\\beta_{59} = 0.89\\), \\(SE = 0.04\\), \\(t = -2.86\\), \\(p = .004\\)) or 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_{60} = 0.84\\), \\(SE = 0.04\\), \\(t = -4.10\\), \\(p &lt; .0001\\)), respectfully, were shown to have on average 0.89 or 0.84 times fewer maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE. No other two-way or three-way interaction was shown to be different from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of domestic violence in the household are shown to report on average 1.13 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{67} = 1.13\\), \\(SE = .04\\), \\(t = 3.35\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\)). Those that report a history of domestic violence in the household that are either between the ages of 18 to 24 (\\(\\beta_{69} = 0.79\\), \\(SE = 0.06\\), \\(t = -3.79\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\)), or 25 to 34 (\\(\\beta_{70} = 0.92\\), \\(SE = 0.05\\), \\(t = -1.65\\), \\(p = .098\\)), or 35 to 44 (\\(\\beta_{71} = 0.81\\), \\(SE = 0.05\\), \\(t = -4.03\\), \\(p &lt; .0001\\)), or 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_{72} = 0.81\\), \\(SE = 0.05\\), \\(t = -4.09\\), \\(p &lt; .0001\\)), respectfully, were shown to report on average 0.79, or 0.92, or 0.81, or 0.81 times fewer maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE. Three-way interactions for those who are female that report a history of domestic violence in the household and are either between the ages of 18 to 24 (\\(\\beta_{74} = 1.34\\), \\(SE = 0.10\\), \\(t = 2.95\\), \\(p = .003\\)), or or 45 to 54 (\\(\\beta_{77} = 1.34\\), \\(SE = 0.08\\), \\(t = 3.58\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\)), respectfully, were shown to report on average 1.34 or 1.34 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE. No other two-way or three-way interactions were shown to be different from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of substance addiction in the household are shown to have on average 1.18 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{19} = 1.18\\), \\(SE = 0.06\\), \\(t = 2.94\\), \\(p = .003\\)), but no two-way or three-way interactions were shown to report indicate those with more specific characteristics to report different average number of maximum drinks consumed on one occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of being sexually assaulted through molestation (SA1) that were between the ages of 35 to 44 were shown to report on average 1.29 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{107} = 1.29\\), \\(SE = 0.10\\), \\(t = 2.68\\), \\(p = .007\\)). Those that report a history of being sexually assaulted through molestation along with any two-way and three-way interactions were not shown to report any differently from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of being forced to sexually touch an abuser (SA2) that are also between the ages of 18 to 24 were shown to report on average 0.68 times fewer maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{117} = 0.68\\), \\(SE = 0.14\\), \\(t = -2.73\\), \\(p = .006\\)), but those between the ages of 45 to 54 were shown to report on average 1.29 times more maximum number of drinks compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{120} = 1.29\\), \\(SE = 0.10\\), \\(t = 2.63\\), \\(p = .009\\)). All other two-way and three-way interactions with this ACE were not shown to report any differently from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of emotional abuse were shown to report on average 1.08 times higher maximum number of drinks on an occasion compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{91} = 1.08\\), \\(SE = 0.03\\), \\(t = 2.90\\), \\(p = .004\\)), but no two-way or three-way interactions between a history of emotional abuse were shown to report any differently from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information).\nThose that report a history of there not being an adult in the household who tried hard to make sure their basic needs were met (i.e., Neglect2) was generally shown to report on average 0.74 times fewer drinks compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{151} = 0.74\\), \\(SE = 0.09\\), \\(t = -3.23\\), \\(p = .001\\)). Those with the same history of adversity that were between the ages of 35 to 44 were shown on average to report 1.72 times higher maximum number of drinks compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{155} = 1.72\\), \\(SE = 0.18\\), \\(t = 3.06\\), \\(p = .002\\)), but those that also report being female in along with the previously mentioned qualifications were shown to report on average 0.41 times fewer maximum number of drinks compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{160} = 0.41\\), \\(SE = 0.32\\), \\(t = -2.73\\), \\(p = .006\\)). Those with the same history of adversity that were also between the ages of 45 to 54 were shown to report on average 1.68 times greater maximum number of drinks compared to males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{156} = 1.68\\), \\(SE = 0.18\\), \\(t = 2.97\\), \\(p = .003\\)), but those with the same history of adversity in the same age group that are specifically female were shown to report on average 0.41 times fewer maximum number of drinks compared males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (\\(\\beta_{161} = 0.41\\), \\(SE = 0.33\\), \\(t = -2.66\\), \\(p = .008\\)). For those who reported a history of there not being an adult in the household who tried hard to make sure their basic needs were met (i.e., Neglect2), there were no other two-way or three-way interactions that were shown to report any differently from the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 4 for further information).\nThere were no one-way or two-way interactions between females and any of the 6 ACEs that indicated increased or decreased risk for the average maximum number of drinks on an occasion in the past month for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6 for further information). In addition, all other interactions between ACEs and age categories were shown not to differ in relative risk for average maximum number of drinks on an occasion for males 65 and older that report no history of any ACE (see Table 6).\nTable 6\nEstimates for ACE Terms and Interactions\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nsexFemale:age55 to

history of adversity both within groups and across when grouped by adversity. Generally for Figures 18 through 23, those that are females tend to report lower average maximum alcoholic drinks consumed on an occasion in the past month compared to males. We also see those who are the youngest appear to drink the highest average maximum alcoholic drinks consumed on an occasion in the past month compared to other ages groups which is also shown to have higher variability.\nFigure 18\nHistory of 1 Adverse Childhood Event and Average Maximum Drinks (last month)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.
