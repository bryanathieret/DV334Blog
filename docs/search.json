    "text": "About Bryana\nMy name is Bryana and I am in my last semester as an undergraduate majoring in Psychology and Statistics at St. Lawrence University. I will be going into a PhD program for Behavior Analysis after I graduate investigating addiction and addiction-like behavior particularly in vulnerable and sensitive populations. The past 3 years I have been fortunate to do animal model research evaluating the long-term effects of chronic early-life stress on impulsive-like behavior. This blog will revolve around these topic in order to increase awareness through beautiful and easily digestible data visualizations."

    "section": "Dataset",
    "text": "Dataset\nThe first data set we will be exploring is data scrapped from a CDC website article named, “Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences Among U.S. Adults — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2011–2020” and can be found here in Table 1. This data was collected from 2011 to 2020 and is one of the most complete surveys that has currently been done in the United States on adverse childhood event prevalence.\nThe information scraped from the website is the summary statistics by state and categorized by adverse childhood type. More specifically, the adverse childhood events were categorized by emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member. Generally speaking, these are the 8 most commonly collected adverse childhood events. In addition, we also have the response rate by state and year which is an important measure to keep in mind when evaluating the data due to response bias.\nIMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Adverse childhood experiences that are emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse are events that happen directly to the child. In comparison, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member are adverse childhood experiences where the child is present (i.e., a bystander). These events create instability and uncertainty for a child resulting in a chronic stress environment and have been shown repeatedly to increase risk for a multitude of illnesses and risky/maladaptive behaviors.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThis dataset has many abbreviations and could be interpreted wrong without the following operational definitions from the study expressed in questions asked (These were not the only questions asked to determine if the person experienced a specific adverse childhood event, but I hope this gives a better idea on how this was defined).\n\nEmotional abuse (Emotional):\n\n“How often did a parent or adult in your home ever swear at you, insult you, or put you down?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nPhysical abuse (Physical):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever hit, beat, kick, or physically hurt you in any way? Do not include spanking” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSexual abuse (Sexual):\n\n“How often did anyone at least 5 years older than you or an adult, ever try to make you touch them sexually?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nSeparated/Divorced (SeparatedDivorced):\n\n“Were your parents separated or divorced?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nMental illness in the household (Mental_Illness_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill or suicidal?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nSubstance Use in household (Substance_Use_HH):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who used illegal street drugs or who abused prescription medications?” (answers: no vs. yes)\n\n\nDomestic violence in household (DV):\n\n“How often did your parents or adults in your home ever slap, hit, kick, punch or beat each other up?” (answers: never vs. at least once)\n\n\nIncarcerated household member (Incarcerated_HM):\n\n“Did you live with anyone who served time or was sentenced to serve time in prison, jail, or other correctional facility?” (answers: no vs. yes)"

    "text": "Response Rate\n\nA “good” response rate is about 95%, but because this is a very sensitive topic we see a much lower response rate. The reason why response rate is important to keep in mind is because you are more likely to have response bias in your data (i.e., those who are passionate or care about responding do respond and those who don’t care do not leaving the data biased). This is just something we should keep in mind as we look at the data because states with a response rate of 40% are going to have a different bias level compared to states with a response rate of 60%.\n\nThis map shows that there was higher response rates from states in the middle of the country compared to the states on the west or east coast. Mississippi had by far the highest response rate compared to all other states."

    "section": "Substance Use in the Household",
    "text": "Substance Use in the Household\n\nOn prevalence of substance use in the household, there looks to be a general prevalence overall of 25%, but greater prevalence in the northwest (not exclusively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nPrevalence of physical abuse shown through the map appears to be greater in the southwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Illness in Household\n\nThis map graph is interesting because it appears mental illness in the household is most prevalent in a much greater way in Utah compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic Violence in Household\n\nInterestingly, in this map we see Nevada stand out as having a much greater percentage of domestic violence compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual Abuse\n\nOregon stands out as having a larger percentage of sexual abuse occur compared to all other states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncarcerated Household Member\n\nIn the map, we see a trend of higher percentages of a household member being incarcerated in the southeast region. This generally makes sense because those states have a tendency to have a higher percentage of residences that are people of color, and due to systemic racism, those with a darker complexion are more likely to be incarcerated wrongfully or for petty crimes compared to white people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates Above 75th Percentile\nSomething I noticed when doing this is that many of the states above the 75th percentile for a specific adverse childhood event prevalence showed up multiple times. To evaluate this further I decided to do the graph below which shows all the states that were included in at least one 75th percentile dataset to evaluate exactly how many times specific states showed up in the 75th percentile across different adverse childhood events.\nIn a sense, it does make sense that if a state had shown up once in a 75th percentile datasets that they would most likely show up again because instability leads to more instability. This visual, in my opinion, shows a real problem occurring within certain states."

    "text": "Demographics of Those Experiencing ACEs\n\nGender\nThe gender category consisted of males or females. We know gender is a spectrum and I would like to acknowledge that these two categories do not represent everyone especially as a general population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments:\n\nOverall, a greater percentage of females report experiencing ACEs compared to males.\n\nSimilarities between genders for ACE reporting is shown for categories of emotional abuse and parental separation or divorce, but females report a greater prevalence of substance use in the household, sexual abuse (this large difference could also be due to under reporting for males because it is very stigmatized), mental illness in the household, and domestic violence in the household compared to males who report a greater prevalence of physical abuse and having an incarcerated household member.\n\n\n\nAge\nThe age category consisted of 6 groupings: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and \\(\\geq\\) 65. Understanding prevalence of ACEs at different ages can provide vital information as to trends through different generations of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Age Group:\n\nThe figure above shows the prevalence of ACEs decreasing over generations which is a positive finding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories for domestic violence in the household, physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental separation or divorce, and substance use in the household show a general increase between age categories 55-64 through 25-34 but show a decrease in age grouping 18-24. This could be indicative of positive change occurring.\n\nACE categories for emotional abuse, mental illness in the household, and having an incarcerated household member show little to no change from age groups 18-24 to 25-34 which demonstrates a continued problem observable over generations.\n\n\n\nRace and Ethnicity\nThe race and ethnicity category consisted of 8 groupings:\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic,\n\nHispanic or Latino,\n\nBlack or African American, non-Hispanic,\n\nAsian, non-Hispanic,\n\nMultiracial, non-Hispanic,\n\nAI/AN, non-Hispanic (American Indian/Alaska Native),\n\nOther race, non-Hispanic,\n\nNH/OPI, non-Hispanic (Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Race/Ethnicity Group:\n\nWhite is a bit over represented here for the population of the United States and more marginalized categories are slightly under represented in this sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nIn particular, for ACE categories of emotional abuse, incarcerated household member, mental illness in the household, and substance abuse in the household, both Multiracial and American Indian’s and/or Alaska Native’s report to have a much higher prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\nFor ACE categories of having an incarcerated household member and parental separation or divorce, people with race/ethnicity of Multiracial, American Indian and/or Alaska Native, or Black/African American report a much higher prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\nFor ACE categories of domestic violence in the household and sexual abuse, people with race/ethnicity of Multiracial, American Indian and/or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander report to have the greatest prevalence of these adverse experiences compared to other races.\n\n\n\nIncome\nThe income category consisted of 5 groupings:\n\n&lt;$15,000,\n\n$15,000-$24,999,\n\n$25,000-$34,999,\n\n$35,000-$49,999,\n\n&gt;$50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Income Group:\n\nA large percentage of those participating in this survey are making greater than $50,000 per year, but not as large as one might expect considering the average income in the US (in 2023) is just below 60,000 according to the census.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories of domestic violence in the household, parental separation or divorce, physical abuse, and sexual abuse have distinct trends where higher prevalence results in increased impairments in yearly income. These ACE categories compared to the others all stem from an unstable household where safety may not, and in many cases is not, present which has been shown to lead to profound long-term effects that this visual also illustrates clearly.\n\nACE categories where an increase in prevalence is more subtle to changes in income per year are substance use in the household and having an incarcerated household member.\n\nACE categories where prevalence does not appear to have a severe impact on later income per year are mental illness in the household and emotional abuse.\n\n\n\nEducation\nThe education category consisted of 4 groupings:\n\nLess than high school,\n\nHigh school diploma or GED,\nSome college,\nCollege degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Education Group:\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics the dropout rate from high school was 8.3% in 2010 and 5.2% in 2021, so the survey’s population generally have higher prevalence of not finishing high school compared to the national average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nACE categories for domestic violence in the household, physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental separation or divorce, substance abuse in the household, and having an incarcerated household member show a clear trend that greater prevalence results in much higher rates of dropping out of high school.\n\nBoth emotional abuse and mental illness in the household show a greater prevalence of dropping out of college, but interestingly, those with higher prevalence report also having a college degree compared to it being less prevalent to report dropping out of high school.\n\nOverall, it should be noted that those reporting ACEs of physical abuse, substance abuse in the household, parental separation or divorce, and emotional abuse appear to have a significant impact on dropping out of high school because around 30% of people reporting not completing high school also report one of these ACEs which is a huge problem.\n\n\n\nEmployment\nEmployment consists of 4 groupings:\n\nOther,\n\nUnemployed,\n\nUnable to work,\n\nEmployed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on Total Prevalence by Employment Group:\n\nThe figure above shows that the majority of those in the survey are employed or other. I was unable to find anything conclusive on what the category other meant in this survey, but based on some searching the “other” category used when asked about employment often refers to self-employment or being an independent contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments on Prevalence by Category:\n\nMost categories of ACEs have those reporting unemployment or unable to work as relatively the same prevalence (i.e., domestic violence, physical abuse, and mental illness in the household), but those who have experienced adversity of emotional abuse, parental separation or divorce, or having an incarcerated household member are shown to report more unemployment compared to unable to work.\n\nBoth sexual abuse and substance use in the household report higher prevalence of unable to work compared to unemployed.\n\nAll ACE categories besides sexual abuse report higher prevalence of employed compared to “other” whereas those who report sexual abuse have the same prevalence for being employed compared to “other”."

I do not have the original data from this study which is limiting. Another factor that should be mentioned is that this data was collected through surveys and was likely to have a response bias from the low response rate.\nI have yet to see anyone do this or explore this avenue of how the type of ACE effects a person, and based on the findings, it should be further looked into how or if differing types of ACEs have different risk factors along with result in different long-term effects for the person. If we know certain populations are more at risk for certain ACEs, our goal should be targeting those populations to prevent, or limit, the ACE before it occurs."
