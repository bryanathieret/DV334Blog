### About Bryana  

My name is Bryana and I am in my last semester as an undergraduate majoring in Psychology and Statistics at St. Lawrence University. I will be going into a PhD program for Behavior Analysis after I graduate investigating addiction and addiction-like behavior particularly in vulnerable and sensitive populations. The past 3 years I have been fortunate to do animal model research evaluating the long-term effects of chronic early-life stress on impulsive-like behavior. This blog will revolve around these topic in order to increase awareness through beautiful and easily digestible data visualizations.
