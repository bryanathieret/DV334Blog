I will be going into a PhD program for Behavior Analysis after I graduate investigating addiction and addiction-like behavior particularly in vulnerable and sensitive populations. The past 3 years I have been fortunate to do animal model research evaluating the long-term effects of chronic early-life stress on impulsive-like behavior. This blog will revolve around these topic in order to increase awareness through beautiful and easily digestible data visualizations."

This data was collected from 2011 to 2020 and is one of the most complete surveys that has currently been done.\nThe information scraped from the website is the summary statistics by state and categorized by adverse childhood type. More specifically, the adverse childhood events categorized for were emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence in the household, substance use in the household, mental illness in the household, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member. These are the 8 most commonly collected adverse childhood events. In addition, we also have the response rate by state and year which is an important measure to keep in mind when evaluating these statistics due to response bias."
